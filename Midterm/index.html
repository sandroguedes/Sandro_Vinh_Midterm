	<p>Cats are instinct hunters, unlike dogs they can climb tree have sharp claws to hunt any animals, so if you have a cat your house will get rid of mouse instead having a dog. By the way, cats are more adorable than dogs, making cute face doing trick better than dogs</p>
	<p>Dogs, on the other hand, they just barking nonsense get you in trouble with neighbor and your sleep, they usually bite of your shoe, make your house look like a mess</p>
	<p>That's why cats are better than dogs</p>
