	<h1>Midterm`s Cats vs Dogs</h1>

	<h2>Dogs are awesome / Cats are lame</h2>

	<p>Dogs are humanity`s oldest animal buddies, and it shows! After about 15.000 years walking alongside us, they`ve evolved into the perfect pets for people of all ages and dispositions.</p>
	<p>Throughout all those years, they have made crude attempts at pleasing us humans into a form of art. Dogs are, in fact, so good at reading human behaviour that they can actually predict our dispotions to a degree, all in order to please us, their "hoomans".</p>
	<p>Cats, on the other hand, are nothing but wingless buzzards. They couldn't care less about us, as long as we are both feeding them and cleaning their litter boxes.</p>
	<p>PS - This last bit is a big fat lie, as I own both a dog a two cats lol</p>
